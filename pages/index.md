Welcome to the Flourish! 2014 Open Source Conference website! 
This is Flourish Conference's **eighth** annual student-led conference hosted 
at the [The University of Illinois at Chicago](http://uic.edu). We are proud to help promote 
the use of open source and provide a gathering place for open source enthusiasts 
in the Chicagoland area.

Throughout the weekend, we will bring speakers from around the country to talk about 
their contributions to the open source community. Topics ranging from getting started 
with FLOSS to the the development of free and open source software. During the days, 
join us in our workshops to gain some hands-on experience.

Flourish Conference is **FREE** to attend and there will be free T-Shirts to those who register 
in advance. We really appreciate everyone for coming to Flourish Conference for the past 
several years and we hope to bring another great and educating year!
