Thank you for your interest in sponsoring the Flourish! 2014 open source computing conference! The conference seeks to bring together some of the brightest developers and thinkers from the open source community to Chicago. We hope that through community-driven presentations, workshops, and other activities, we can all promote a feeling of interconnectedness and 
inspire others.

The open source philosophy states that software source code should be free, easily shared, and available to anyone. This philosophy of openness has allowed for the creation of software such as the Linux operating system, the Firefox web browser, Wikipedia and the Apache web server. Presently, it has permeated almost every facet of the computing world, as well as attracted a variety of talented developers and progressive businesses into embracing the open source philosophy. 

Started in 2006 by a group of computer hobbyists at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the Flourish! Conference was designed to fill a void in the open source community. For the past four years, the conference has attracted students, enthusiasts and the business community alike and has allowed them to connect, share ideas and discuss recent developments. This year, an even larger group of volunteers from all over the community has taken up the mantle to make the conference our best yet.

With your contribution, we can afford to create an amazing conference and, once again, bring together the vibrant Chicago open source community. As a sponsor, you'll be able to introduce yourself to the talent of the community and become a part of it.

We've included a guide of what you can expect with your donation along with this document. If you have questions or concerns, please contact the Flourish Organizers, by email at [info@flourishconf.com](mailto:info@flourishconf.com?Subject=Flourish%202014%20Sponsorship%20Information).
