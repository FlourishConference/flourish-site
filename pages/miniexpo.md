Flourish! Open Source Conference is not just a conference with talks and workshops. We also host a mini-expo for various companies and organizations to represent themselves to the audience throughout the conference. Organizations ranging from your favorite non-profit to the latest, most hip, but not very well known startup non-profit come to our mini-expo to show you what they've got. We also have Chicagoland companies come to represent their products and contributions to the open source community. So in between talks, after the day is over, or if you come in early, drop by the mini-expo and find out what Chicago really has to offer!
