#Flourish!

This will soon be the new Flourish website for 2014 and on. It is still a work in progress.

## Static Site Generator

There's a static site generator included. It'll output the generated site in a new `_site` directory. To run the generator you need to have [Paver](http://paver.github.io/paver/), [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/), [Misaka](http://misaka.61924.nl/), and [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) installed.

To install those, you can (and probably should) use pip:

``` shell
# pip install Paver Jinja2 misaka pyyaml
```
